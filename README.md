## Overview
For this project, I want you to visualize data from a dataset of your choice. The dataset has to be rich

enough so that you can create the following charts:

    • A chart that shows the distribution of a single categorical variable
    • A chart that shows the distribution of a single quantitative variable
    • A chart that shows the distribution of two categorical variables
    • A chart that shows the distribution of a quantitative variable across categories of a categorical variable
    • A chart that shows the relationship between two quantitative variables

For some of the charts above, you should also show what happens when you take a third or fourth

variable (categorical or quantitative) into account, by using tools such as faceting or other coloring

dots in a scatterplot.

Finally, please also construct at least one chart type that we have not directly discussed in class and

on handouts, such as:

    • Radar or spider (-web) charts for showing summary statistics (such as means) across several
    categories of a categorical variable. Side-by-side versions of these (so, adjusted for a third
    categorical variable) are especially effective.
    • Heatmaps. For example, you learned about the correlation matrix in Machine Learning.
    Obtain the correlation matrix of four or five quantitative variables (or “features”), and
    visualize it using a heatmap.
    • Contour Plots, for showing the joint distribution (density) of two quantitative variables.
    Contour plots are the extension of density plots for one continuous variable. For instance,
    you can visualize the joint distribution of two quantitative variables from your dataset with
    contour plots.
    • Sunburst charts to show the distribution of two or more categorical variables. (This is
    harder, and the best implementation I know is in plotly.)
    This is not an exhaustive list and you can explore other chart types on your own! My point is that
    you learn how to research a particular graph type and then apply it to your data.
    
Finally, don’t forget that the reason for creating graphs is to convey information, and so for every

chart you are making, please provide a short paragraph below it that explains what the graph is

telling us about your data.

What to turn in:

    • Do not work on this on the last minute. Beginning mid next week, I’ll monitor your GitHub
    repositories for gradual progress!
    • Turn in a document that shows key graphs and aspects of your data exploration. Don’t put
    every graph you created in this document. It needs to be polished and it needs to read like a
    high-level report. Also, I’m restricting the length to no more than 4 pages.
    • Prepare a four-minute class presentation on your analysis and findings and upload the slides
    for your presentation.
    • Also upload a two-minute video (for instance, recorded using Skype where you can screen-
    share) that presents your data and your key findings together with the graph that visually
    explore them. Make sure the video plays in Canvas!
